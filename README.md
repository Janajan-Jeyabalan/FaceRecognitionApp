# FaceRecognitionApp

This application uses machine learning to detect and recognize faces in photos or live video streams.

# Usage

The application will prompt you to upload an image or provide a video stream from your webcam. <br/>

Once the image or video stream is loaded, the application will detect and recognize any faces in the image/video. <br/>

If a face is recognized, the application will display the name of the person. If the face is not recognized, it will display "Unknown".  <br/>

You can also add new faces to the recognition model by providing a name and a set of images of the person's face.  <br/>
